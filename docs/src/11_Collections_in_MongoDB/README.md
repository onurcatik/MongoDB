# MongoDB Collections Tutorial

In this tutorial, we'll delve into collections, exploring how to create, manage, and manipulate them using MongoDB.

1. Understanding Collections:

   - In MongoDB, a collection is a group of documents.
   - Documents are analogous to rows in relational databases, and collections are similar to tables.
   - A database can contain one or more collections, each catering to a specific type of data.
2. Viewing Collections:

   - To view the collections in a database, use the `show collections` command.
   - Example:

     ```bash
     show collections
     ```

3. Creating Collections:

   - Collections can be created using the `db.createCollection()` method.
   - Syntax: `db.createCollection(name, options)`
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     db.createCollection("teachers", { capped: true, size: 10000000, max: 100, autoIndexId: false })
     ```

   - Explanation:
     - `capped`: Specifies whether the collection has a maximum size.
     - `size`: Sets the maximum size of the collection in bytes.
     - `max`: Sets the maximum number of documents in the collection.
     - `autoIndexId`: Specifies whether to automatically index the `_id` field.
4. Dropping Collections:

   - To drop a collection, use the `db.collectionName.drop()` method.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     db.courses.drop()
     ```

5. Additional Collection Options:

   - Apart from the basic options mentioned above, MongoDB offers more advanced options for collections.
   - These options are beyond the scope of this tutorial but include features like sharding and custom indexes.
6. Recap:

   - Collections are essential components of MongoDB databases.
   - They store related documents and provide efficient data organization and retrieval.
   - Understanding how to create, manage, and manipulate collections is crucial for effective MongoDB usage.
